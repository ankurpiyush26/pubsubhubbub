Here are all the potential places PubSubHubbub could be used in Google products and the current status, if any...

| **Product** | **Role** | **Status** | **Notes** |
|:------------|:---------|:-----------|:----------|
| Feedburner | pub | **95% done** | All burned feeds with PingShot enabled are now pinging the reference hub.  Few bugs are being ironed out, then we can call this 100% done. |
| Blogger | pub | <b><b>95% done</b></b> | Live in production!  (need to add the discovery tag for RSS too, though...) |
| Google Alerts | pub | .. | the RSS feeds that you can create from http://www.google.com/alerts|
| YouTube | pub | .. | uploads, favorites, etc... |
| PicasaWeb | pub | .. | new photos (is there an Atom feed?) |
